**Triggers and Functions** is a JavaScript engine for data processing in Redis. Triggers and Functions support on-demand and event-driven processing of Redis data. To use Triggers and Functions, you write functions that describe how the data should be processed and you register triggers that describe the keyspace notifications or stream that will execute the function.
